# Portfolio Website

This project renders a single, responsive, portfolio webpage. The portfolio is split into a number of sections with a fixed navigation bar on top. The first section is a hero image with title text. The second section consists of a gallery of cards, each containing summary information relating to projects. The third and final section is an 'about me' - a brief narrative, photo and icons for mail, Github and LinkedIn.
